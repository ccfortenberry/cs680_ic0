# CS680 Iditarod Challenge 0
## Goal
The purpose of this iditarod challege is to research a game engine that can export to either HTML5 or WebGL formats. In this case I chose the Godot engine.
## Pros
It's basically all of the good things from UE4 and Unity wrapped up in a relatively easy to dive into package, and can support more languages than GDScript with a little work for better performance or working with a more familiar language.
## Cons
Debugging is kind of a nightmare; error messages are often inaccurate or unhelpful. On top of that there's no simple way to override inherited values other than through scripting and sometimes that does not work either.
